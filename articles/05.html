            The coronavirus and its victims - How COVID-19 has changed how we
            die. <br> Nearly 80,000 people have died of COVID-19 since the coronavirus
            pandemic hit Germany. Behind every statistic lies a sad personal story
            about the fates of individuals and their families.
            One terrible thing about COVID-19 is not just that people are dying of it,
            but the circumstances in which they die. A COVID-19 death often occurs
            in isolation, behind closed doors. How can we cope with this? Reporters
            Nicola Albrecht and Susann von Lojewski examine how COVID-19 has
            changed our experience of death. They speak to people who have lost
            loved ones, such as Manu, who lost his fiancée Brittanya to COVID-19 -
            she was just 29. Posting on Instagram from her sickbed, rapper Brittanya
            gave herself and her fans confidence to fight the battle against the virus.
            She died a few days later. Ralf Brepohl lost his mother and has been
            asking himself ever since whether he was the one who infected her. He
            says that he would never forgive himself. Often, intensive care workers
            
            are the last people allowed to accompany patients who are sick and
            dying of COVID-19. And even if they are now used to it, COVID-19 is
            pushing them to the limit. Nurse Celine Pinkau from Senftenberg
            describes the moment she had to put a patient she’d grown fond of into a
            clinically sealed body bag. &quot;I cried. I thought, ‘Where is the humanity in
            this? Where is the dignity?’&quot; Hospital chaplains like Stefan Pfeifer are not
            always able to comfort bereaved family members. He is worried that
            being unable to say goodbye to their loved ones will take a major
            emotional toll on them. The film shows how COVID-19 has brutally
            disrupted our death rituals and asks how we can give as much dignity as
            possible to the dying, also in the time of the coronavirus.
