            Deaths Due To COVID-19 In The World Reaches 5 Million People JAKARTA - The world&#39;s COVID-19 deaths surpassed the five million
            mark on Friday, according to Reuters data. It took the world more than a
            year to reach the first 2.5 million COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic,
            but the second 2.5 million was achieved in just under eight months. An
            average of 8,000 deaths were reported daily worldwide in the past week,
            or about five deaths per minute. More than half of the global death toll in
            that week&#39;s average came from the United States, Russia, Brazil, Mexico
            and India. The total death toll in the US on Friday crossed 700,000, the
            highest in the world.
            While COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the US are trending down,
            the country&#39;s health authorities are bracing for a spike in winter when
            people are more active indoors. On the same day Russia reported 887
            deaths, the country&#39;s highest daily figure for a year pandemic.
            South America is the region with the highest mortality rate in the world,
            accounting for 21 percent of all reported deaths. The region is followed
            by North America and Eastern Europe, which each account for more
            than 14 percent of all deaths, according to a Reuters analysis. , the
            death toll in India -- one of the countries hardest hit by the Delta variant --
            has dropped dramatically from an average of 4,000 per day to less than
            300 when the vaccination program was launched. Delta is now the
            world&#39;s dominant variant of the coronavirus and has been found in 187 of
            the 194 member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO).
            These variants have shown different vaccination rates high levels
            between rich and poor countries. World attention in recent days has
            focused on efforts to share vaccines with poor countries, where many
            people have not received the first dose. At the same time, people in
            wealthier countries are starting to be given booster doses. More than half
            of the world&#39;s population has not received a single dose of the COVID-19
            vaccine, according to Our World in Data. WHO said this week that for the
            first time the COVAX program will distribute doses only to countries with
            the lowest vaccination rates. The vaccine sharing program since January
            has allocated most of the vaccine doses to more than 140 recipient
            countries in proportion to the population. assistant Director-General of
            WHO, in a recording of last week&#39;s conference presentation uploaded to
            the WHO&#39;s official website.
