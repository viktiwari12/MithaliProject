            Germany mourns 100,000 COVID-19 deaths Germany has become the latest country to pass the sad threshold.
            According to figures from the country&#39;s Robert Koch Institute, 100,000
            people have now died of COVID-19. Behind every number is a name,
            and a person.
            A year ago, Kerstin lost her 83-year-old father to COVID-19.
            &quot;I&#39;m sure he knew that we were there,&quot; she said, telling DW of his final
            days in a hospital bed. &quot;Even if I was only able to stroke his forehead
            with my gloved hand.&quot;
            Kerstin lives in Düsseldorf — 600 kilometers (about 370 miles) from her
            parents, who were based in Berlin. Despite the virus&#39; infectiousness and
            strict social distancing restrictions, the hospital called to say a final visit
            was possible. To Kerstin, the oldest daughter, the choice was clear.
            &quot;I at least wanted to say goodbye to my father,&quot; she said. With her son,
            she got in her car and drove to Berlin to spend 10 minutes with him. &quot;We
            were head-to-toe in plastic,&quot; she remembered. Her father died the next
            day.
            
            He had been taken into hospital with tuberculosis and only contracted
            the coronavirus later, probably from a doctor who was treating him. Now
            he is one of Germany&#39;s 100,000 people — according to figures from the
            Robert Koch Institute for Disease Control — who has since officially died
            from the illness. Kerstin&#39;s memories prompt laughter and tears, as she
            recalls her father&#39;s life and the randomness of his death.
            Caregivers have also suffered.
            Nurses have been struggling in the pandemic, seeing people being put
            on ventilators with their health deteriorating.&quot;We&#39;re all afraid of dying,&quot;
            caregiver Rita Kremers told DW.
            One of her colleagues died from the virus in the ICU, she said, six weeks
            after infection. &quot;It really hits you when it&#39;s a person you knew who dies,&quot;
            she said.
