                        COVID, death and mourning in Germany: &#39;No one should have to die
            alone&#39;
            People have been dying lonely deaths in nursing homes and hospitals
            around Germany due to coronavirus pandemic and restrictions on close
            contact. It has been devastating for those they leave behind.
            &quot;We weren&#39;t allowed to ride in the ambulance with him or enter the
            hospital. We couldn&#39;t talk to his doctors. It was horrific,&quot; says Silke
            Kleibömer, recalling the day her father was rushed to the hospital — April
            28, his birthday. He was &quot;terrified,&quot; says his daughter, &quot;he knew his life
            was coming to an end.&quot;

            Hans-Jürgen had a pulmonary disease and had been on oxygen for
            years. He was doing so poorly that the family called paramedics. He died
            in the hospital&#39;s intensive care unit (ICU) just seven days later.
            During the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic hospitals and nursing
            homes imposed restrictions and bans on outside contact. After a
            loosening of rules over the summer, they are once again getting stricter
            as infection rates rise. State and federal governments say they are
            committed to protecting at-risk individuals in hospitals and nursing
            homes.
            Rapid testing is to be implemented to facilitate visiting regulations, as
            restrictions don&#39;t just affect COVID-19 patients. They also affect people
            like Silke Kleibömer&#39;s father Heinz-Jürgen.
            In the hospital, doctors found that he had pneumonia. Silke Kleibömer
            says it was impossible to talk with her father on the telephone. &quot;We
            called him every day, for about 10 or 20 seconds,&quot; she says — after that
            he was out of breath. &quot;Anyone who has ever suffered shortness of breath
            knows that it&#39;s deadly terrifying,&quot; she adds.
            &#39;He didn&#39;t want to go&#39;
            When Silke&#39;s mother called the hospital to find out what the family should
            expect, she was harangued by a doctor who yelled at her that they didn&#39;t
            have the time to talk with every relative who called. When the father was
            moved  into intensive care, no one bothered to inform the family. Silke
            Kleibömer, who runs an outpatient nursing service herself, says she can&#39;t
            understand such attitudes: &quot;Then you have to delegate. We&#39;re just talking
            about making time for a phone call here.&quot;
            Indignant, Kleibömer called and demanded to speak with the ICU&#39;s on-
            duty doctor and told him: &quot;We&#39;re coming right now.&quot; When they got there,
            she and her mother got to see her father &quot;It was hard to understand him
            but he had all his faculties …&quot; Silke Kleibömer stops and begins to cry.
            She excuses herself and says, &quot;He told us he loved us. He was so
            strong, he looked me straight in the eye and told me not to cry. My dad
            fought so hard. He didn&#39;t want to go.&quot;
            &#39;Papa waited for us&#39;
            Visits were possible in ICU but only for one person and only for a
            maximum of one hour each day. Still, the staff were accommodating.
            That was also the case on May 5, when alarms began ringing at her
            father&#39;s bed. The call came from the hospital, saying: &quot;You have to come

            now! Hurry!&quot; Silke Kleibömer picked up her mother and rushed to the
            hospital. They assembled there at his side, wife, daughter, and three
            grandchildren: &quot;Papa waited for us. We could all be with him. We are so
            grateful to the ICU staff. We weren&#39;t really supposed to be there.&quot;
            She says the doctor told her &quot;every colleague decides for themselves,&quot;
            adding that they may not have been so lucky on another day. She knows
            how fortunate she and her family were, saying: &quot;We got to hold his
            hand.&quot; Then her father quickly and peacefully passed away, &quot;You could
            see the relief on his face.&quot;
